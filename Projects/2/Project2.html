    <h1>CIS 505/705, (Introduction to) Programming Languages, Fall 2018.</h1>
<h2>Assignment #2 (25 points). Due on Monday, October 15, 2018, 8am</h2>
Use SML/NJ to write an interpreter for a simple imperative language <tt>L</tt>
which  
manipulates integers and arrays of integers,
and which
reads from an input stream and writes to an output stream.

<h3>Language Syntax</h3>
The syntax of <tt>L</tt> is given by the grammar
<pre>
P : Program
C : Command
E : Expression
D : Declaration
N : Numeral
I : Identifier

P ::= D C

C ::=  skip |  C1 ; C2  |  if E { C1 } { C2 }  |  while E { C }  
   |  I = E   |  I [ E ] = E  | output E  |  input I

E ::=  N  |  I  |  I [ E ]  |  (E1 + E2)  |  (E1 * E2)  |  (E1 - E2)

D ::= int I; D2
   |  array I N ; D2 
   |    &lt;nothing&gt;

N ::=  strings of digits

I ::=  strings of letters or digits, starting with a letter, 
           not including keywords
</pre>

<h3>Language Semantics (Informal)</h3>

<h4>Integers</h4>
The basic type is integers, of which
the positive integers are considered true
(for tests in <tt>if</tt> and <tt>while</tt> commands),
whereas zero and the negative integers are considered false.
<p>
Integer variables must be declared in the beginning of the program,
using the <tt>int</tt> construct.
<p>
The default value of an integer variable (before it is first assigned to)
is zero.
<p>
<h4>Arrays</h4>
In the beginning of a program, one can also declare array variables,
using the construct <tt>array</tt> <i>A</i> <i>n</i> with <i>n</i> a constant.
This creates an array <i>A</i> with <i>n</i> elements, which can be accessed
as <i>A[0]</i>,...,<i>A[n-1]</i> (other references are invalid).
Initially, these elements are all zero.
<p>
<h4>Locations</h4>
Rather than letting the interpreter directly associate variables to values,
it is convenient (and crucial for implementing more advanced languages)
to explicitly model <em>memory locations</em>.
<p>
<h4>Stores</h4>
A store maps locations to values. Executing a command may change the store,
whereas evaluating an expression will not change the store.
<p>
<h4>Environments</h4>
We have two environments: the integer environment maps integer
variables to locations, whereas the array environment maps array variables
to sequences of locations. These environments are created when processing
the declarations, and are never subsequently modified.
(The same variable name may appear in both
environments but I wouldn't recommend that programming style.)
<p>
<h4>Expressions</h4>
To evaluate an expression, we need the two environments (to find the
locations of variables and array elements) as well as the store (to find the value in
a location).
<p>
Since there must be parentheses around subcomputations,
there is no ambiguity in how to calculate an arithmetic expression.
<p>
<h4>Commands</h4>
The interpreter executes commands by updating
the store, the input stream, and the output stream.
<ul>
<li>
The command <tt>skip</tt> does nothing, while &quot;;&quot;
denotes sequential composition.
<p>
<li>
The conditional <tt>if</tt> and the looping construct
<tt>while</tt> behaves as one would expect (given the above
remark about which values are true/false).
<p>
Observe that a statement <tt>while E {C}</tt> is equivalent to
<tt>if E {C; while E {C}} {skip}</tt>
<p>
<li>
<tt>output</tt> appends a value to the output stream;
<tt>input</tt> takes a value from the input stream.
<p>
<li>
An assignment <tt>x = E</tt> stores the value of the expression
<tt>E</tt> in the location denoted by the integer variable <tt>x</tt>.
<p>
<li>
An assignment <tt>A[i] = E</tt> stores the value of the expression
<tt>E</tt> in the <tt>i</tt>th location of the array variable <tt>A</tt>
<p>
</ul>

<h3>Example Programs</h3>
As a simple example of a program written in <tt>L</tt>, 
consider the following that reads two numbers from input and returns their sum:
<pre>
   int n; int m; input n; input m; output (n+m)
</pre>
Your interpreter, given the above program and the input list [7,2],
should thus return the list [9].
<p>
We can program the factorial function:
<pre>
   int n; int fac; input n; output n; fac = 1; while n {fac = (fac * n); n = (n-1)}; output fac
</pre>
Your interpreter, given the above program and the input list [4],
should thus return the list [4,24].
<p>
We may even write a loop that computes the factorial of each value in
the input stream, up until the first zero:
<pre>
   int n; int fac; input n; while n {output n; fac = 1; while n {fac = (fac * n); n = (n-1)}; output fac; input n}
</pre>
Your interpreter, given the above program and the input list [3,6,5,0,4],
should return the list [3,6,6,720,5,120].
<p>
Using arrays, we may implement the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort">insertion sort</a>
algorithm:
<pre>
  int n; int m; int x; int i; int j; int t;
  array A 100; input n; m = n; i = 0;
  while m {input x; A[i] = x; i = (i + 1); m = (m - 1)}; i = 1;
  while (n - i) {j = i;
     while j {
        if (A[(j-1)] - A[j])
          {t = A[j]; A[j] = A[(j-1)]; A[(j-1)] = t; j = (j-1)}
          {j = 0}};
     i = (i + 1)};
  i = 0; while (n - i) {output A[i]; i = (i + 1)}
</pre>
Your interpreter, given the above program (you may need to put everything on one line) and the input list [8,11,3,5,9,7,14,2,10]
(with the first input 8 denoting the number of subsequent elements),
should return the list [2,3,5,7,9,10,11,14].
<p>
<h3>Functionality of Interpreter</h3>
Your interpreter should take an <tt>L</tt> program,
and a list of input values to be read successively,
and return a list of the values printed.
<p>
For example, typing
<pre>
  Interpret "int n; int m; input n; input m; output (n+m)" [7,2];
</pre>
should make SML respond <tt>val it = [9] : int list</tt>.
<p>
To allow you to focus on the semantic aspects, a 
parser has been provided for you.
It converts an input string
into operator trees that are represented using
SML datatypes.
<p>
To further help you, a skeleton interpreter has also been provided.

<h3>Error Messages</h3>
If your interpreter encounters an error,
it should still terminate gracefully
but with an informative message as designed by you.
<br>
Possible errors are:
<ul>
<li>
An integer variable, or an array variable, is used without having been declared.
<li>
The program tries to read from an empty input stream.
<li>
An array is referenced with an index that is out of the proper range.
</ul>


<h3>Guidelines for Writing the Interpreter</h3>
You should build on the program given in the file
<tt>HW2_skeleton.sml</tt> which is uploaded on Canvas.

<p>
<h3>Submission</h3>
You must do this exercise on your own.
<p>
Submit to Canvas an .sml-file containing the
interpreter.
<p>
Do <em>not</em> 
expect the instructor or the TAs to answer any questions after Friday, October 12, at 4pm.
<p>
<b>Important</b>:
It is certainly OK to discuss the assignment with 
the instructor, TAs, or your fellow students, 
but all the coding must be typed by you,
and all the concepts in the coding must be stored in your head so that 
you can reproduce them on demand.
